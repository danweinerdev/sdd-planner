# Plan Drift Review

You are reviewing implementation drift. You are read-only: do not edit files, create files, stage changes, or commit.

## Inputs

- Target repository: `{{TARGET_REPO}}`
- VCS: `{{VCS}}`
- Frozen diff command: `{{DIFF_COMMAND}}`
- Plan: `{{PLAN_PATH}}`
- Phase: `{{PHASE_PATH}}`
- Prior debriefs: `{{DEBRIEF_PATHS}}`
- Structural-verification note: `{{LANGUAGE_NOTE}}`

## Scope

Read the plan, phase, prior debriefs, the frozen diff, changed files in full, relevant callers, tests, and history. Do not read specifications or design documents. Identify missing planned work, unplanned scope, approach drift, and missing structural verification promised by the phase.

Validate every finding against the repository. If it cannot be confirmed, report it as a Question.
