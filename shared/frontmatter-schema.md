# Frontmatter Schema

Single source of truth for all artifact metadata in this project.

## Common Fields

Every artifact includes these fields (one exception: `phase` docs omit `tags` and `related` — they inherit the plan's):

```yaml
title: "Human-readable title"
type: research | brainstorm | spec | design | plan | phase | debrief | retro | diagram | decision-log
status: <type-specific, see below>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
related: [Specs/FeatureName, Research/topic-slug.md]
```

`related` entries are planning-root-relative: use the **directory** path for specs, designs, and plans (`Specs/FeatureName`, `Designs/ComponentName`, `Plans/PlanName`), and the **file** path for flat artifacts (`Research/topic-slug.md`, `Brainstorm/topic-slug.md`, `Retro/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, `Diagrams/slug.md`). Consumers that need the document behind a directory entry append `/README.md`.

Any artifact may additionally declare an optional `refresh_when` field — a list of event-shaped trigger descriptions that force a refresh (e.g., `refresh_when: ["dependency X ships v3", "Specs/Payments changes", "vendor answers the webhooks question"]`). `/tend` checks these: a fired trigger makes the artifact stale regardless of its `updated` date; demonstrably-unfired triggers exempt it from the default 30-day staleness rule.

## Status Values by Type

| Type | Statuses |
|------|----------|
| research | `draft`, `active`, `archived` |
| brainstorm | `draft`, `active`, `archived` |
| spec | `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `implemented`, `superseded` |
| design | `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `implemented`, `superseded` |
| plan | `draft`, `approved`, `active`, `complete`, `archived` |
| phase | `planned`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `blocked`, `deferred` |
| task | `planned`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `blocked`, `deferred` |
| debrief | `draft`, `complete` |
| retro | `draft`, `complete` |
| diagram | `draft`, `active`, `archived` |
| decision-log | `active`, `archived` |

## Stable Identifiers & Traceability

Numbered elements carry stable, per-document identifiers so artifacts can cite each other precisely and reconciliation is greppable:

| Element | Id format | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Functional requirement | `FR-NN` | spec Requirements |
| Non-functional requirement | `NFR-NN` | spec Requirements |
| Acceptance criterion | `AC-NN` | spec Acceptance Criteria |
| Phase / task | `N` / `N.M` | plan frontmatter (existing convention) |
| Decision | `D-NNNN` | decision ledger |

Rules:

- **Ids are append-only and never renumbered.** Removing an item leaves its id retired (strike the line or note "removed — see <reason/citation>") so existing cross-references never silently re-bind to a different item.
- **Cross-reference by id.** A plan task's `verification` (or its body section) names the `AC-NN`/`FR-NN` ids it satisfies; a design section that realizes a requirement cites its `FR-NN`; governed sections cite ledger ids (`D-NNNN`) per `shared/decision-log.md`. These citations are what make drift detectable — without them every reconciliation check is blind.
- **Changing a numbered element is a reconciliation event**: after editing it, grep the other artifacts for its id and update or flag every citing site (same pattern as the decision ledger's supersession cascade). The Tend skill's completeness mode audits for unnumbered elements and dangling id citations.

## Decision Ledger Schema

The decision ledger (`Decisions/decisions.md`, type `decision-log`) carries a `decisions[]` frontmatter array — the same structured-list convention as `phases[]`/`tasks[]`. Entry fields, lifecycle rules (append-only; accepted entries mutate only via `status` + `superseded_by`), the collision procedure, and distribution rules are defined in `shared/decision-log.md` — the single source of truth for this artifact.

Per-entry statuses (these are entry-level fields inside `decisions[]`, **not** artifact `type` statuses — the ledger artifact itself is only ever `active` or `archived`): `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `superseded`. `rejected` entries are kept as negative truths, never deleted.

## Plan Schema

### Plan README.md

```yaml
---
title: "Plan Title"
type: plan
status: active
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
related: [Specs/FeatureName, Designs/ComponentName]
phases:
  - id: 1
    title: "Phase Title"
    status: planned
    doc: "01-Phase-Title.md"
  - id: 2
    title: "Phase Title"
    status: planned
    doc: "02-Phase-Title.md"
    depends_on: [1]
---
```

Body contains: Overview, Architecture, Key Decisions, Dependencies, Open Questions (omit when empty — a plan cannot be `approved` while an in-scope question is unanswered).
No status tables in the body — the dashboard reads phases from frontmatter.

### Phase Doc (01-Phase-Title.md)

```yaml
---
title: "Phase Title"
type: phase
plan: PlanName
phase: 1
status: in-progress
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
deliverable: "What this phase delivers"
tasks:
  - id: "1.1"
    title: "Task title"
    status: planned
    verification: "How we know this task is good and complete"
  - id: "1.2"
    title: "Task title"
    status: planned
    depends_on: ["1.1"]
    verification: "Specific criteria to confirm correctness"
---
```

#### Task Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | yes | Task identifier (e.g., "1.1") |
| `title` | yes | Human-readable task title |
| `status` | yes | Task status (see status values above) |
| `depends_on` | no | List of task IDs this task depends on |
| `verification` | yes | How we know the work is good and complete — name each new or changed behavior to cover, not test counts. Where the check is commandable, include the exact command and expected observable output (e.g., `cargo test auth:: — 14 pass incl. the new refresh-expiry case`); prose-only criteria are for behavior no command can observe |

Body contains task detail sections keyed by task ID as headings:

```markdown
## 1.1: Task Title

### Subtasks
- [ ] Subtask one
- [ ] Subtask two

### Notes
Implementation notes...

### Trap
Optional — only for tasks with a known tempting-but-wrong shortcut. Names
the shortcut a hasty implementer would take and why it's wrong. /implement
passes it verbatim to the implementer's dispatch.
```

## Debrief Schema

Debriefs live at `Plans/<PlanName>/notes/<NN>-Phase-Name.md` and add three fields to the common set:

```yaml
---
title: "Phase N Debrief: Phase Title"
type: debrief
status: complete        # draft while being written incrementally
plan: PlanName          # the plan directory name
phase: 1                # the phase number this debrief covers
phase_title: "Phase Title"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: []
related: []
---
```

## Dashboard Color Mapping

Consumed by the companion `sdd-dashboard` plugin and by `/diagram`'s status styling (`classDef` colors):

- `complete` / `approved` / `implemented` -> green
- `in-progress` / `active` / `review` -> amber
- `planned` / `draft` -> gray
- `blocked` -> red
- `deferred` / `archived` / `superseded` -> muted
