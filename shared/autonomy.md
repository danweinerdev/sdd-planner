# Autonomy Table

Cross-skill view of what runs autonomously versus what stops for the user. Each skill's own Escalation Rules section is the operational text; this table is the consolidated pattern — when writing or revising a skill, keep its rules consistent with this table.

## Runs autonomously (never ask)

| Work | Notes |
|---|---|
| Reads, searches, agent dispatch | Including parallel waves and resumes |
| Artifact writes that follow templates and scripted status transitions | `sdd-plan` writing `draft`, `sdd-implement` flipping task statuses, etc. |
| Wave-to-wave progression in `sdd-implement` | Unless unresolved critical findings are pending end-of-wave escalation |
| Retries within budget | One resume with clarified guidance after a failure (2 attempts total) |
| Non-critical review findings | Collected and presented at end of wave, work continues |

## Stops for the user (always ask)

| Decision | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|
| Destructive actions — deleting data, prod config, shared systems | `sdd-implement` escalation rules; `code-implementer` |
| Approval transitions — spec/design/plan `approved` | `sdd-specify`, `sdd-design`, `sdd-plan`; explicit user sign-off only |
| Gated scope — in-scope work depends on an unanswered external question | `sdd-plan`, `sdd-specify`, `sdd-design`; reviewers flag as Critical |
| Plan-vs-reality mismatch — the plan describes a codebase that doesn't exist as written | `code-implementer` STOPs; `sdd-implement` surfaces, never patches around it |
| Spec amendment — a contract test can only pass by weakening the assertion | `code-implementer` STOPs; `spec-compliance` flags as Critical |
| Scope expansion discovered mid-implementation | `sdd-implement` escalation rules |
| Critical findings unresolved after 2 review-fix cycles | `sdd-implement` — task `blocked`, no next wave without a decision |
| Target repo unresolvable | `shared/path-resolution.md` — ask, never guess or clone |
| External review lanes on a repo that isn't the session's project | `sdd-code-review` trust gate |
| Rehearsal opt-in for high-risk plans | `sdd-plan` — costs real implementation spend |
