# Review Artifacts

Single source of truth for **persisted review artifacts** — the durable, trackable record of adversarial and code reviews. Every Poke Holes and Code Review run writes its findings to a review file instead of leaving them in conversation scrollback, and every finding is driven to an explicit disposition in a Resolution Log. Findings that live only in a chat transcript get lost; findings with ids in a tracked file do not.

## Location — reviews live with what they review

Precedence: **Plans > Designs > Specs.** The review file goes in a `reviews/` directory beside the reviewed artifact's README:

| Reviewed material | Review home |
|---|---|
| Implementation vs a plan (Code Review) | `Plans/<Plan>/reviews/` |
| A plan or phase (Poke Holes) | `Plans/<Plan>/reviews/` |
| A design | `Designs/<Component>/reviews/` |
| A spec | `Specs/<Feature>/reviews/` |
| A flat artifact (brainstorm, research) | the nearest governed home via its `related` frontmatter (one hop, same precedence); if none resolves, present findings inline and say the review was not persisted |

Create the `reviews/` directory on first use (with a `.gitkeep`-style placeholder only if the VCS needs one).

## Naming

```
<NN>-<target-slug>-<review-type>-<rev>.md
```

- `NN` — next zero-padded sequence number within that `reviews/` directory.
- `target-slug` — lowercase kebab-case of the reviewed artifact (plan/design/spec name).
- `review-type` — `adversarial-review` (Poke Holes) or `code-review`.
- `rev` — the state the review examined: for Code Review, the reviewed repo's
  native SCM revision. A phase gate requires a frozen durable revision/range;
  dirty or no-SCM work is not eligible for completion.

Example: `01-arkagent-adversarial-review-a1b2c3d.md`.

## File Format

Template: `shared/templates/review.md`. Frontmatter is type `review` with a machine-readable `findings[]` array (same structured-list convention as `phases[]`/`tasks[]`/`decisions[]`):

```yaml
findings:
  - id: F-01                 # stable within this file; never renumbered
    severity: critical       # critical | major | minor | question
    title: "One-line finding"
    status: open             # open | fixed | deferred | rejected | answered
```

The body carries one section per finding — the concrete scenario, why it matters, the recommended mitigation, and the artifact/code ids it impugns (`FR-NN`, `AC-NN`, task `N.M`, `D-NNNN`) — followed by the Resolution Log.

Artifact `status`: `open` while any finding is `open`; `resolved` when every finding has a terminal disposition; `superseded` when a newer review of the same target replaces it (link both ways, like ledger supersession).

## Phase-completion review gate

When a review is used to complete a phase, it is a persisted final gate, not a
general advisory review. Freeze a concrete native-SCM phase revision/range, run
all four `sdd-code-review` lanes, and record these frontmatter fields:

```yaml
review_scope: phase
frozen: true
verdict: Aligned
reviewed_planning_revision: "<full planning Git commit reviewed>"
review_mode: independent # independent | mixed | single-agent
lane_results:
  - lane: review_plan_drift
    result: PASS/Aligned
    reviewed_identity: "<exact rev>"
    evidence: "<nonempty auditable result>"
  - lane: review_quality
    result: PASS/Aligned
    reviewed_identity: "<exact rev>"
    evidence: "<nonempty auditable result>"
  - lane: review_spec_compliance
    result: PASS/Aligned
    reviewed_identity: "<exact rev>"
    evidence: "<nonempty auditable result>"
  - lane: review_blind_spots
    result: PASS/Aligned
    reviewed_identity: "<exact rev>"
    evidence: "<nonempty auditable result>"
```

`lane_results` is the auditable four-lane record: it contains exactly these four
lanes once, every result is `PASS/Aligned`, every `reviewed_identity` exactly
equals `rev`, and every evidence value is a specific concrete observation (not
blank or a generic conclusion such as `passed`, `ok`, `aligned`, `success`, `No
findings`, or `No blocking findings`). Record inspected paths, behaviors, or
observations even when a lane is clean. `review_mode` records how the lanes ran:
`independent`, `mixed`, or `single-agent`.

`reviewed_planning_revision` is required and is the full Git commit in the
planning repository at which the phase and plan README were reviewed. Before
phase completion, the validator loads both artifacts at that commit and compares
their lifecycle-normalized content with current artifacts. It permits only
lifecycle fields, completion evidence, and checklist state to change. This
binding uses the planning SCM identity directly; SDD stores no custom intent
hashes. A planning SCM without this validated adapter keeps the phase
non-complete with an explicit diagnostic.

The phase's `Final aligned review` evidence points to this artifact and its
frozen identity. `Needs changes` or `Blocked` forbids phase completion. Every
review-driven material code fix must receive a new planned task id and be
implemented as a complete, reviewable task revision, even when it is small.
Any material change after review (behavior, public contract,
architecture, security, concurrency, persistence, error handling, acceptance
coverage, or meaningful test logic) supersedes the review and requires a fresh
full four-lane review of the new frozen range. Repeat until the final review is
`Aligned` and its reviewed state is materially unchanged.

Use the exact phase-evidence syntax `- Final aligned review: <artifact path>;
frozen: <revision/range>`; the nonempty `frozen` value must exactly equal this
artifact's `rev`. **Git review-identity adapter:** `rev` and `frozen` are only an
exact `<full40>..<full40>` range with distinct endpoints; every named commit must
exist in the target repository, the base must be an ancestor of the endpoint, and
the endpoint must exactly equal the phase evidence's clean full `Revision /
checkpoint` commit. **Git lifecycle
adapter:** the exact cited artifact must be
committed at planning-root `HEAD`, and the committed bytes/frontmatter must
still establish resolved status, this phase's `review_of`, `rev`, frozen phase
scope, `Aligned`, review mode, and all four lane results. These are adapter
rules, not universal SCM assumptions: no deterministic non-Git target
review-identity adapter or validated Perforce/no-SCM lifecycle adapter is
currently available, so those cases must leave the phase non-complete with the
adapter diagnostic.

## Resolution Log

When findings are acted on, append (never rewrite) entries under `## Resolution Log` at the bottom of the review file, one per finding disposition:

```markdown
### F-03 — fixed (2026-07-17)
Split task 2.4's migration into its own task 2.7 with a rollback step.
Governing fact: AC-04 requires zero-downtime cutover. Commit: abc1234.
```

- Every entry states **what was decided, what was done**, and — for `deferred`/`rejected` — **why**. Cite the governing facts by id (`D-NNNN`, `FR-NN`, `AC-NN`, task ids, commits).
- Update the finding's `status` in `findings[]` to match; the frontmatter is the machine layer, the log entry is the narrative.
- Dispositions: `fixed` (change applied), `deferred` (tracked follow-up — see below), `rejected` (won't fix, rationale required), `answered` (a question resolved; if the answer constrains future work, it belongs in the decision ledger too).

## Acting on findings — the disposition rules

Classify each finding before touching anything:

- **Mechanical fix — apply directly.** The correction is fully determined by *hard facts*: an `accepted` decision-ledger entry, the explicit text of an approved spec/design/plan, or an objectively verifiable fact (a path exists, a command's output, a pinned external contract). No judgment call remains. Apply the fix, cite the governing fact in the Resolution Log entry. This is a template-following write per `shared/autonomy.md` — no user stop.
- **Design decision — stop and discuss.** The fix requires choosing between viable approaches, changes the meaning or scope of an approved artifact, or touches anything an accepted ledger entry governs (or would supersede one). Present the options with trade-offs and let the user decide. Record the outcome in the decision ledger per `shared/decision-log.md` (collision check; a fresh answer colliding with an accepted entry uses one-step supersession), then execute and log the resolution citing the new `D-NNNN`.
- **When the bucket is ambiguous, treat it as a design decision.** A false stop costs one confirmation; a wrongly-autonomous "fix" silently forks the truth.

## Reconciliation — after fixes land

A resolution that edits a numbered element (`FR-NN`, `AC-NN`, a task, a governed section) is a **reconciliation event** per `shared/frontmatter-schema.md` § Stable Identifiers: grep the other artifacts for the changed id and update or flag every citing site. Spec, design, plan, and phase docs must agree before the review is marked `resolved` — a fix applied to one artifact while its citations elsewhere still describe the old behavior is drift, not resolution.

## Follow-ups never float

`deferred` is only a valid disposition when the work is **tracked**: add it as a plan task (new task id, normal `verification` field) in the relevant phase — or, when no plan exists yet, record it in the review frontmatter as a follow-up entry:

```yaml
followups:
  - id: FU-01
    finding: F-05
    summary: "Add backpressure test for the retry path"
    tracked_in: ""        # filled with the task id (e.g. "3.4") once planned; empty = not yet landed
```

A review with any `followups[]` entry whose `tracked_in` is empty is not fully resolved — it may be `resolved` only if the user explicitly accepts the floating follow-up, and `sdd-validate` keeps flagging it until it lands in a plan. This is the net that keeps implementation follow-ups from getting lost.
