# Path Resolution

## Planning root

Artifacts (`Research/`, `Brainstorm/`, `Specs/`, `Designs/`, `Plans/`, `Retro/`, `Diagrams/`) are read from and written to the planning root.

1. Find `planning-config.json` in the current directory or its parents through the repository root.
2. If no config exists, use the repository root and treat `planningRoot` as `"."`.
3. If config exists, resolve `planningRoot` relative to the config's directory unless it is absolute. An absent value and `"."` mean the config directory.

## Plugin resources

Locate bundled resources as described in `shared/agent-runtime.md`. The `shared/` directory belongs to the installed plugin and is read in place; never copy or symlink it, the plugin, or skill files into the planning root or target repository. Templates under `shared/` may be rendered into generated SDD artifacts, but the template files remain under `<plugin-root>/shared/`.

## Target repository

Plans can target another repository. If specified, provide the target directory path directly.
