# {{TITLE}}

{{DESCRIPTION}}

This repository keeps spec-driven development artifacts under `{{PLANNING_ROOT}}/`. Use the installed `sdd-planner` skills by asking the agent for the relevant activity in natural language.

## Artifact Layout

## Conventions

- Artifact metadata lives in YAML frontmatter. Status values are the source of truth.
- Plans stay under `Plans/<PlanName>/`; never move them to express lifecycle state.
- A phase owns task status and subtask checkboxes. Update them only after actual verification.
- Use `planning-config.json` to resolve the planning root.
- Consult the plugin's frontmatter schema, templates, and language-verification references when creating or changing artifacts.

## Lifecycle

Use these skills as needed: setup, research, brainstorm, specify, design, plan, implement, code review, simplify, debrief, retro, poke holes, tend, diagram, and excavate.

The normal progression is: setup -> research -> brainstorm -> specify -> design -> plan -> implement -> code review -> simplify -> debrief -> retro. It is valid to enter at any point when the corresponding artifacts already exist.

## Review And Execution

Before implementation, confirm an approved plan has concrete verification criteria. During implementation, record command output for checks actually run. Use the Code Review skill before phase completion or merge when material code changed. For project-specific review requirements, keep a short trusted review brief in this `AGENTS.md`; do not rely on auto-discovered agent files.
