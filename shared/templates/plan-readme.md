<!-- sdd-validate format contract:
- Store this document as UTF-8 with LF line endings and keep the YAML
  frontmatter as a mapping between standalone `---` delimiters.
- Keep `title`, `type`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `tags`, and `related`;
  dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` and status is one of `draft`, `approved`, `active`,
  `complete`, or `archived`.
- Keep every H2 heading supplied by this template with exactly the shown text.
- Keep `tags`, `related`, `phases`, and every `depends_on` value as YAML lists.
  Related values are nonempty planning-root-relative artifact paths that
  resolve; do not use absolute paths, backslashes, `.` segments, or `..`.
- Every phase mapping requires nonempty `id`, `title`, `status`, and `doc`.
  Phase IDs are unique; status uses the phase status vocabulary; `doc` is
  relative to this README and resolves to a `type: phase` document whose
  `plan`, `title`, `phase`, and `status` match this plan and entry. Every phase
  document is listed exactly once by the README in its physical plan directory.
  Dependencies reference phase IDs in this plan and contain no unknown IDs,
  self-dependencies, or cycles.
- An approved, active, or complete plan must cite every FR-NN, NFR-NN, and
  AC-NN from every related spec in phase task verification/detail or phase
  Acceptance Criteria. Directly related designs collectively cite every
  FR-NN and NFR-NN from those specs. Requirement citations must resolve through
  the `related` graph; live artifacts do not cite rejected/superseded D-NNNN
  ids.
- A complete plan has only complete phases and populated completion evidence.

## Overview
What this plan delivers and why it matters.

## Architecture
High-level technical approach. Use Mermaid diagrams where visual structure helps (e.g., `graph TD` for component relationships, `flowchart LR` for data flow).

## Key Decisions
Major choices made and their rationale.

## Dependencies
External dependencies, prerequisites, and assumptions.

## Plan Completion Evidence

<!-- Keep the exact `Pending — not complete.` line until completion. Evidence
uses the exact labels `Verified`, `Repository`, `VCS`, `Revision / checkpoint`,
and `Identity recheck`, each as `- <label>: <value>`.
`Verified` is `YYYY-MM-DD`; `Repository` is the exact resolved target root;
`VCS` is `git`, `git-worktree`, `perforce`, or `none`; record the tested native
SCM revision/checkpoint. Git adapter: `Revision / checkpoint` is a full 40-hex
implementation commit; commit implementation before recording evidence, then
commit only lifecycle/evidence bookkeeping separately. Normal Git completion
creates no snapshot, projection, content-object, or `evidence/` folder. Only
fallback dirty Git, Perforce, or no-VCS identity adds
`Fallback reason`, `Evidence exclusions`, `Governing intent`, `Ignored inputs`,
`Directory inputs`, and `Content snapshot`; dirty Git uses a full base suffixed
`-dirty`. `Fallback reason` names the specific VCS or authorization constraint.
Perforce and no-SCM planning roots may retain fallback handoff evidence but have
no validated durable lifecycle adapter, so they must remain non-complete.
`Governing intent` uses `<64-hex SHA-256> at <durable path>; inputs:
<comma-separated artifact paths and decision ids>`. The fallback
`Ignored inputs` and `Directory inputs` use `none with <inspection basis>` or
`paths: <comma-separated repository-relative paths>; <digests/basis>`. The exact
table columns are `Command | Working directory | Result | Observable evidence`
or `Tool / inspection | Context | Result | Observable evidence`. Command
results use `PASS (exit 0)`; tool/inspection results use `PASS`. `Identity
recheck` names the tool, an ISO date/time through minutes, and a
matched/matching identity. Follow shared/completion-evidence.md for identity,
rollup, and durability rules. A complete rollup uses one
`### Phase <id> Evidence Rollup` and one `### Task <id> Evidence Rollup` block
per child and repeats that child's exact command/tool rows in its block. -->
Pending — not complete.

<!-- Optional — include only when questions are open; a plan cannot be
     approved/active/complete while a blocking question remains. Every retained
     question goes in an `## Open Questions` section and uses the exact form
     `- {{QUESTION}} — **non-blocking** — {{WHY_THE_PLAN_HOLDS_REGARDLESS}}`. -->
