# SDD Planner Skills

`sdd-planner` is a runtime-neutral agent-skills plugin for spec-driven development. It creates and maintains Markdown planning artifacts with YAML frontmatter for research, specifications, designs, implementation plans, code review, debriefs, and retrospectives.

Every capability is a plain `SKILL.md` skill with shared resources under `shared/` — no slash commands, named subagent types, hooks, or model-specific instructions — so it works in any agent runtime that discovers `SKILL.md` skills, with any model:

- **OpenCode**: point a skills discovery path at this repository (for example `ln -s <this-repo> ~/.agents`, so the skills resolve as `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), or mount it there in a container.
- **Codex**: install via the `codex-marketplace` repository, then install `codex-sdd-planner` from it. Start a new thread after installation so the skills are available.
- Any other runtime that loads the `.agents/skills` convention or directory-sourced skills works the same way.

Ask your agent for a workflow naturally: "set up spec-driven planning in this repository", "write a specification for this feature", or "review this implementation against the active plan."

Planning artifacts live in the root configured by `planning-config.json`. The plugin uses `AGENTS.md` for optional repository guidance and does not create tool-specific files or launchers.
