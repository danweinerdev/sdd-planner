# SDD Planner Skills

`sdd-planner` is a runtime-neutral agent-skills plugin for spec-driven development. It creates and maintains Markdown planning artifacts with YAML frontmatter for research, specifications, designs, implementation plans, code review, debriefs, and validation.

Every capability is a plain `SKILL.md` skill with shared resources under `shared/` — no slash commands, named subagent types, runtime hooks, or model-specific instructions — so it works in any agent runtime that discovers `SKILL.md` skills, with any model. Public skill names use the `sdd-` prefix (`sdd-plan`, `sdd-implement`, `sdd-code-review`, and so on) to avoid collisions in global skill directories (D-0004):

`sdd-code-review` exposes stable semantic identifiers for its four independent
review lanes. Runtime adapters may map those identifiers to specialized workers
or models, but the skill never names or depends on them and retains its serial
single-agent fallback (D-0008).

`sdd-implement` uses the stable runtime-neutral implementation dispatch
identifier `implement_task` when a runtime task name or description field is
available. Runtime adapters may select a worker without the skill requesting an
agent or model, and the primary-agent fallback remains transparent (D-0009).

- **OpenCode**: point a skills discovery path at this repository (for example `ln -s <this-repo> ~/.agents`, so the skills resolve as `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), or mount it there in a container.
- **Codex**: install via the `codex-marketplace` repository, then install `sdd-planner` from it. Start a new thread after installation so the skills are available.
- Any other runtime that loads the `.agents/skills` convention or directory-sourced skills works the same way.

Ask your agent for a workflow naturally: "set up spec-driven planning in this repository", "write a specification for this feature", or "review this implementation against the active plan."

Planning artifacts live in the root configured by `planning-config.json`. The plugin uses `AGENTS.md` for optional repository guidance and does not create tool-specific files or launchers.

Tasks, phases, and plans carry durable completion-evidence sections recording
the exact commands, tools, context, revision, and observed results used to
justify each `complete` transition (D-0005).

The compact core exposes: `sdd-setup`, `sdd-research`, `sdd-brainstorm`,
`sdd-specify`, `sdd-design`, `sdd-plan`, `sdd-implement`, `sdd-code-review`,
`sdd-poke-holes`, `sdd-debrief`, `sdd-decide`, `sdd-decision-log`, and
`sdd-validate` (D-0006). Codebase excavation is a mode of `sdd-research`;
diagramming, retrospectives, and generic simplification are outside the core.

`sdd-validate` runs `scripts/sdd_validate.py` for deterministic artifact
integrity checks before applying model judgment to semantic sufficiency. The
script requires PyYAML as declared in `requirements.txt` and supports text or
JSON diagnostics suitable for local use and CI.

After plan approval, the `sdd-plan` skill conditionally hands the approved artifact to
the independently installed `sdd-beads-publish` skill when that skill is
available. The integration is capability-detected: `sdd-planner` has no hard
dependency on Beads or the `sdd-beads` plugin, and an unavailable Beads
workspace leaves the approved SDD plan unchanged.
