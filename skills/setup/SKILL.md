# Configure Spec-Driven Planning

## Resources

Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/vcs-detection.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/templates/agents-md-full.md`, and `<plugin-root>/shared/templates/agents-md-snippet.md`.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## Process

1. Determine the target directory. Use the user-provided path verbatim where possible; otherwise use the current directory. Stop for a bare git repository.
2. Determine `planningRoot`: explicit user value, existing `planning-config.json`, inherited worktree value, then `"."`. Preserve the chosen value exactly in config; resolve relative paths only for filesystem operations.
3. Write or preserve `<target>/planning-config.json`. Include optional `title`, and `description` only when requested.
4. Create missing planning directories: `Plans/`, `Research/`, `Brainstorm/`, `Specs/`, `Designs/`, `Decisions/`, `Retro/`, and `Diagrams/`.
5. For Git or Perforce, ensure the appropriate ignore file contains `Dashboard/` without duplicating entries.
6. Offer, but do not unprompted create, `AGENTS.md` guidance. Use the full template for a dedicated planning repository; append the snippet for an existing project. Preserve existing user instructions.
7. Do not create Claude launchers, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` folders, plugin symlinks, or copies of the plugin, skills, or shared resources. The runtime discovers and reads the installed plugin through its own skill-discovery paths; setup writes only SDD configuration, artifact directories, ignore entries, and user-approved `AGENTS.md` guidance to the target.

## Output

Report target path, detected VCS, stored planning root, created directories, config/ignore changes, and whether `AGENTS.md` guidance was added.
