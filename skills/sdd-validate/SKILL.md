# Validate SDD Artifacts

## Resources

Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then
derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback
search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including
`$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex
`${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill
roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and
the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read
`<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md`,
`<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`,
`<plugin-root>/shared/frontmatter-schema.md`,
`<plugin-root>/shared/completion-evidence.md`, and
`<plugin-root>/shared/decision-log.md`, and
`<plugin-root>/shared/review-artifacts.md`.

Before analyzing artifacts in model context, run the bundled deterministic
validator from the target repository root:

```bash
python3 <plugin-root>/scripts/sdd_validate.py --format json
```

Pass `--scope <planning-root-relative-path-or-artifact-name>` when the user
named a narrower scope. Scoped validation includes every discoverable artifact
selected by that path/name and follows transitive explicit `related` links; a
plan scope therefore covers all plan-owned artifacts plus its governing related
graph even when the scope names its README or one phase (D-0013). Bare names
that match multiple artifact roots are rejected as ambiguous; use the reported
planning-root-relative path. JSON output lists the exact successfully parsed
`artifacts_in_scope`, while diagnostics for malformed files under the requested
scope remain visible. Unresolved
references remain diagnostics on the artifact that cites them; an existing but
undiscoverable file is never claimed as validated. PyYAML is a declared plugin dependency in
`<plugin-root>/requirements.txt`; if it is unavailable, report the validator's
dependency error and stop rather than silently replacing deterministic checks
with model judgment. Exit `0` means scripted checks passed, exit `1` means the
JSON diagnostics are authoritative findings, and exit `2` means validation
could not run. Never execute artifact-recorded evidence commands as part of
validation.

For a direct decision-ledger write or focused ledger audit,
`scripts/sdd_decision_validate.py <resolved-ledger> --format json` provides the
stricter standalone format, archive, supersession, structural-candidate, and
Git-backed immutability checks required by `shared/decision-log.md`. The full
validator remains authoritative for cross-artifact scope resolution, citations,
and related-graph checks.

Identity mode defaults to `auto`, which performs current target-worktree and
governing-projection checks for every populated evidence section. Use the
equivalent explicit `--identity-mode current` immediately before a completion
transition or tracker closure. Use `--identity-mode historical` only for a
confirmed historical audit where later legitimate work makes current-source
comparison inappropriate.

**Read-only guarantee:** validation never edits, moves, creates, or deletes
artifacts and never changes status. Report exact findings for a lifecycle skill
or user-authorized repair to address.

## Scope

Validate the named artifact or, when asked for repository-wide validation, all
artifacts under the resolved planning root. Read complete plan README and phase
documents when validating any plan lifecycle state.

## Checks

The script owns machine-decidable structure, schema, path, identifier, graph,
review-state, decision-link, durable-digest, and evidence-shape checks below.
Do not repeat those checks manually or reinterpret a scripted failure. After it
runs, use model analysis only for semantic sufficiency: whether prose has real
content, evidence proves the cited behavior and acceptance criteria, aggregate
evidence covers the deliverable, and differently worded decisions potentially
conflict. Merge those semantic findings with the script diagnostics in the
required output format.

For every scoped spec, design, or plan, resolve its explicit `related` graph and
perform a cross-artifact semantic reconciliation after the script passes its
citation matrix checks:

- Compare each `FR-NN`, `NFR-NN`, constraint, and accepted decision in the spec
  with the linked design. Report omitted behavior, incompatible contracts, and
  design choices that exceed or narrow approved scope.
- Compare the linked design with plan phases, task boundaries, dependencies,
  traps, and verification. Report architecture with no implementation task,
  tasks that contradict the design, and verification that cannot prove the
  governing `AC-NN` behavior.
- Compare the plan directly back to the spec so a shared design omission cannot
  make both downstream artifacts appear mutually consistent.
- Actively test the unhappy paths named by the governing artifacts: null/empty
  boundaries, ownership and cleanup, errors, concurrency, retries/timeouts, and
  cross-tenant or security boundaries where applicable.

The script proves citation presence, not semantic conformance. Never report the
artifacts reconciled merely because every identifier appears somewhere.

### Structure and frontmatter

- YAML parses and required common/type-specific fields exist.
- Status values match `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`.
- Required template sections exist with the exact H2/H3 names consumed by the
  validator. The scripted check proves heading presence; the semantic pass
  separately rejects empty or placeholder-only required content.
- Plan phase `doc` paths, `related` links, and decision scopes resolve.
- Legacy status-subfolder layouts are invalid; report them without migration.

### Hierarchy, dependencies, and traceability

- Plan README phase ids/statuses match their phase documents.
- Every phase document is `type: phase`, matches its plan entry's title/id/status
  and plan backlink, lives under that plan, and is listed exactly once.
- Task and phase `depends_on` ids resolve, are not self-referential, and form no
  cycle.
- Required requirements and acceptance criteria are numbered. `FR-NN`,
  `NFR-NN`, and `AC-NN` are unique within their owning spec; task and phase ids
  within their plan; `F-NN` and `FU-NN` within their review; and `D-NNNN`
  across the live decision ledger and archives. Citations resolve against the
  owning or explicitly related artifact rather than a repository-global id.
- Complete parent entities contain no incomplete child entity.
- When Git HEAD contains the prior artifact, spec requirement ids and plan
  phase/task ids remain present in both index and worktree; deletion, rename,
  type substitution, or hidden staged removal is invalid.
- Approved/implemented specs and designs and approved/active/complete plans
  contain no blocking Open Questions; retained bullets use the exact
  `**non-blocking** — <rationale>` form.

### Review artifacts

- Frontmatter finding status matches its Resolution Log disposition; an
  artifact is `resolved` only when every finding is terminal.
- Every deferred finding is tracked either by an existing plan task cited in
  its resolution or by a corresponding `FU-NN`. Every nonempty
  `followups[].tracked_in` value resolves to an existing plan task. Always
  report an empty `tracked_in` as floating; explicit user acceptance may permit
  the review's `resolved` status but does not suppress that finding.
- Review supersession links are bidirectional and resolve.

### Completion evidence

Apply `shared/completion-evidence.md` literally:

- Every task, phase, and plan has its required evidence section.
- A complete entity has fully conforming retrospective evidence: verification
  date; repository root and VCS kind; exact tested native SCM
  revision/checkpoint (a Git implementation commit only in the Git adapter) or
  canonical content snapshot digest and durable artifact for a
  genuine fallback; a successful immediate identity recheck; exact
  commands/tools; context/working directory; exit
  status or result; and specific observable evidence covering prospective
  verification.
- **Git adapter:** normal clean-Git evidence contains no fallback projection,
  snapshot, content-object, or exclusion fields. The implementation revision
  exists and is an ancestor of the current branch, and the populated planning
  evidence is present in a committed lifecycle artifact. Later feature commits
  do not stale an earlier task's immutable implementation revision.
- Semantically inspect the recorded native revision/checkpoint's diff against
  the task boundary: it must implement that task's complete feature slice,
  exclude other independently complete slices, and leave the named checks
  passing. Ancestry alone cannot establish semantic revision scope.
- Every required final and aggregate check passed. Missing, unrun, vague,
  stale, or failing evidence makes a `complete` status invalid.
- Every completed task records a focused review in strict syntax: for Git,
  exactly `git show <full40>` for final-commit review or `git diff
  <full40>..<full40>` for range review before the required complete-task-diff
  statement, exact
  reviewed candidate/final native SCM identity, and `Review result:
  PASS/Aligned`; a phase gate does not substitute for this. **Git
  review-identity adapter:** accept only the task full commit or
   `diff: <full40>..<full40>` whose distinct commits exist in the target repository,
   whose base is the task revision's direct first parent, and whose endpoint is
   the task revision; the command uses that commit or range with no extra
  operands. Other SCMs use their native exact
  identity until a deterministic adapter exists.
- Phase evidence covers every task and acceptance criterion and cites a
  persisted, resolved, frozen `Aligned` phase review of the phase document
  across all four stable lanes using `- Final aligned review: <artifact path>;
  frozen: <exact rev>` with exact equality to review frontmatter `rev`. Its
  auditable `review_mode` and exactly four `lane_results` record every lane's
   PASS/Aligned result, identical reviewed identity, and specific concrete lane
   evidence rather than a generic conclusion. **Git review-identity adapter:** only
   an exact `<full40>..<full40>` range with distinct commits is valid; every commit
   exists in the target repository, the base is an ancestor of the endpoint, and
   the endpoint equals phase `Revision / checkpoint`. The current target worktree
    is clean at phase completion; every path touched by every commit after the
    reviewed endpoint (including merge and reverted/net-zero changes) must be a
    governing lifecycle path. The canonical phase and plan projections at HEAD
    must equal the frozen endpoint, so scope, requirements, tasks, and acceptance
    text cannot change. Other target changes require a new full review.
   Unsupported
  target SCM adapters keep the phase non-complete with an explicit diagnostic.
  **Git lifecycle adapter:** the cited review's exact bytes/frontmatter are
  committed at planning-root HEAD and still establish its resolved frozen
  Aligned four-lane state. Perforce and no-SCM planning roots have no validated
  durable lifecycle adapter, so complete entities are invalid there. Plan evidence repeats exact task/phase evidence
  rollups and covers the plan deliverable; links alone do not satisfy the
  record. A material post-review code change requires a fresh full phase review.
- Fallback dirty Git snapshot manifests match current changed, nonignored untracked,
  explicitly inventoried ignored, and directory inputs byte-for-byte and by
  mode; staged/index content matches the tested worktree. Flag fallback capture
  used merely to postpone an authorized normal Git feature commit. Fallback
  evidence names the specific constraint that selected it, and every local
  manifest, projection, and content object is durably committed with the
  lifecycle evidence (or uses a validated immutable retained URI).
- Non-complete entities may be pending or contain populated evidence awaiting
  validation.
- Historical complete artifacts without conforming evidence are reported as
  legacy evidence gaps; never infer or fabricate evidence.

### Decision ledger

- Required entry fields and allowed statuses are valid.
- Sequential ids are unique across the live ledger and archives.
- Supersession links are bidirectional and resolve.
- Accepted decisions scoped to an artifact are cited by that artifact.
- Every live-artifact citation to a `superseded` or `rejected` decision is
  reported as stale.
- Deterministic structural collision candidates are reported: differing answers
  to the same question, chosen options present in another entry's `rejected`,
  or divergent definitions of the same term with overlapping scope. Candidate
  diagnostics are nonfatal and require model/user judgment; report potential
  conflicts as questions and never auto-resolve them.

## Output

Open with `Valid` or `Invalid`. For every finding include severity, artifact and
section/line, violated rule, and the exact required correction. Include the
files and checks inspected so absence claims have a search trail. A valid
result names the scope and confirms each check class; it is not a generic
“looks good.”
