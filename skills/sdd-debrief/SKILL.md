# After-Action Phase Notes

## Path Resolution
Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`, and `<plugin-root>/shared/completion-evidence.md`.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## When to Use
When a plan phase has been completed (or substantially completed) and you want to capture what happened: decisions made, deviations from plan, lessons learned, and impact on future phases.

## Process

1. **Identify Target**
   - Scan `Plans/` for plans whose README frontmatter `status` is `active` and that have in-progress or completed phases (debriefs happen during active work)
   - Ask which plan and phase to debrief (or infer from context)
   - Read the phase document to understand what was planned
   - Read the plan README for overall context

2. **Gather Information**
   - Review the phase's tasks and subtasks for completion status
   - Read every task's `### Completion Evidence`; an absent or pending section
     on a complete task is a legacy evidence gap, not proof
   - Read related designs from `Designs/` to identify deviations from intended architecture
   - Read related specs from `Specs/` to assess requirements coverage
   - If more than ~3 related documents are involved, delegate the sweep to a collaboration subagent (if available) instead of reading them all yourself
   - Ask the user about:
     - Key decisions made during implementation
     - What deviated from the original plan or design
     - Problems encountered and how they were resolved
     - Insights to carry forward

3. **Spot Skill Opportunities**
   Review the phase for repeated actions that would benefit from being enshrined as a reusable skill. Look for:
   - Manual sequences you (or the user) ran more than once — multi-step git workflows, recurring investigations, file-munging pipelines, check-lists that were applied by hand
   - Repeated workflow sequences that always went together
   - Codebase operations that lacked a helper/script and had to be redone in each task
   - Checks or validations that should have been automated but were done mentally

   For each opportunity, capture: what the repeated action was, where the skill should live (new skill, a project-level skill, a codebase helper, a shell script, a Makefile target), why a skill would help, and a rough shape (inputs, outputs, when to invoke).

   Ask the user to confirm or extend the list before writing — they may have noticed patterns you didn't.

4. **Write Debrief**
   - Create `Plans/<PlanName>/notes/<NN>-<Phase-Name>.md` using `shared/templates/debrief.md`
   - Fill in the frontmatter: set `created` and `updated` to today, `tags` to themes from the phase, `related` to the specs/designs consulted in step 2, and choose `status` — `draft` if the debrief is being written incrementally and will be revisited, `complete` when finalized in one sitting
   - Fill in all sections: Decisions Made, Requirements Assessment, Deviations, Risks & Issues, Lessons Learned, Impact on Subsequent Phases, **Skill Opportunities**
   - The filename mirrors the phase doc number (e.g., `01-Core-Setup.md` -> `notes/01-Core-Setup.md`)

5. **Backfill the Decision Ledger**
   - For each item in Decisions Made that the user confirmed (step 2) and that isn't already in `Decisions/decisions.md`, append an entry per `shared/decision-log.md` — collision check first; a collision stops for the user. Scope entries to the plan. This is the safety net for decisions made mid-implementation that escaped capture.

6. **Update Phase Status**
   - Require every task to be `complete`, every task completion-evidence
     section to conform to `shared/completion-evidence.md`, and every phase
     acceptance criterion to be checked. Stop without changing phase status if
     any requirement is missing.
    - Freeze a concrete native-SCM phase revision/range and run all four
      `sdd-code-review` lanes before phase completion. Persist the review
      artifact. `Needs changes` or `Blocked` stops completion. Plan and
       give every review-driven material fix a new planned task ID and implement
       it as a complete reviewable task revision, even when it is small, then
       freeze the new range and repeat all four lanes. Any material code change after a
      review invalidates it; repeat until the final review is `Aligned` and the
      reviewed phase is materially unchanged (D-0014).
    - Populate `## Phase Completion Evidence` with the verification date,
      native source identity, identity recheck, concise task-id and native
      revision/checkpoint references, and exact aggregate commands/tools and
      results. Include the persisted final aligned
      review artifact path and frozen revision/range identity using `- Final
      aligned review: <artifact path>; frozen: <exact rev>`; it must exactly
      match frontmatter `rev`. For a Git planning root, commit the exact review
      artifact at HEAD with the lifecycle record. For Perforce or no-SCM
      planning roots, report that no validated durable lifecycle adapter is
      available and leave the phase non-complete. If no additional
     phase-level check applies, state why task evidence covers every phase
     acceptance criterion.
   - Re-read that section, require every required aggregate check to have
     passed, and only then set the phase status to `complete` in both:
     - The phase doc frontmatter
     - The plan README's `phases[]` array
   - Update `updated` dates
   - If this was the final phase and all phases are now complete, populate
      `## Plan Completion Evidence` under the same rules. Record concise phase
      ids, completion revisions/checkpoints, and final review references in the
      required identity section, not an Evidence Rollup. Record the native source
      identity and identity recheck, then record required
     plan-level checks. Re-read it, require every final check to have passed,
     and only then set the plan README frontmatter `status` to `complete`.

## Document Structure
See `shared/templates/debrief.md`:
- **Decisions Made**: Key choices with rationale
- **Requirements Assessment**: Acceptance criteria met/not met
- **Deviations**: What changed from plan and why
- **Risks & Issues Encountered**: Problems and resolutions
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights for the future
- **Impact on Subsequent Phases**: Downstream changes needed
- **Skill Opportunities**: Repeated actions that should become reusable skills
