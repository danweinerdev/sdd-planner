# Technical Architecture Document

## Path Resolution
Read `shared/agent-runtime.md` to locate bundled resources, then read `shared/path-resolution.md` to resolve artifact and target-repository paths.

## When to Use
When you need to define the technical architecture for a component or system before implementation. Produces a reviewable design document with architecture decisions.

## Process

1. **Gather Context**
   - If the user hasn't already specified it, ask what component to design
   - When available, delegate a bounded context scan to a collaboration subagent with the component and its constraints; it scans all artifact directories and the codebase per its own definition.
   - Review any related research documents

2. **Draft Design**
   - Create `Designs/<ComponentName>/README.md` using `shared/templates/design.md`
   - Document: overview, architecture (components, data flow, interfaces), design decisions (with alternatives considered), error handling, testing strategy, migration plan
   - **Use Mermaid diagrams** for architecture, data flow, and component relationships — prefer `graph TD`, `flowchart LR`, or `sequenceDiagram` over ASCII art or prose-only descriptions
   - **Testing strategy must include structural verification:** Read `shared/language-verification.md` and include the language-appropriate structural checks (sanitizers, static analysis, type checking) in the Testing Strategy section. These define what "structurally correct" means for this component beyond passing tests.
   - Set status to `draft`

3. **Review**
   - Set `status: review` when dispatching the reviewer
   - Perform an independent plan-review pass to review the design
   - Address critical and major issues

4. **Present for Approval**
   - Show the user the review results and final design
   - **Open questions gate approval.** Before setting `status: approved`, every remaining open question must be either resolved or explicitly marked **non-blocking** with a one-line rationale for why the design holds regardless of its answer. A question whose answer could change the architecture blocks approval — leave the design at `review` and name the question to the user. A "⚠️ pending confirmation" annotation is not a gate.
   - After findings are addressed and the user explicitly approves, set `status: approved`. If the user declines or defers, leave it at `review`.
   - Then re-read the frontmatter and confirm it parses as YAML and includes `title`, `type`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `tags`, `related`.

## Output
```
Designs/<ComponentName>/README.md
```

## Document Structure
See `shared/templates/design.md`:
- **Overview**: Component role in the system
- **Architecture**: Components, data flow, interfaces
- **Design Decisions**: Each with context, options, decision, rationale
- **Error Handling**: Detection, reporting, recovery
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate
- **Migration / Rollout**: Transition plan

## Context
- Orchestration: `shared/orchestration.md`
- Template: `shared/templates/design.md`
- Schema: `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`
- Agents: a collaboration subagent (if available), an independent plan-review pass
