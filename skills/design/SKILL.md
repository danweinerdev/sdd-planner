# Technical Architecture Document

## Path Resolution
Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md` and `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## When to Use
When you need to define the technical architecture for a component or system before implementation. Produces a reviewable design document with architecture decisions.

## Process

1. **Gather Context**
   - If the user hasn't already specified it, ask what component to design
   - When available, delegate a bounded context scan to a collaboration subagent: render `shared/agent-prompts/researcher.md` with the component, its constraints, and the resolved paths; otherwise perform the research pass yourself following that prompt.
   - Review any related research documents

2. **Draft Design**
   - Create `Designs/<ComponentName>/README.md` using `shared/templates/design.md`
   - Document: overview, architecture (components, data flow, interfaces), design decisions (with alternatives considered), error handling, testing strategy, migration plan
   - Where a section realizes a spec requirement, cite its id inline (`FR-NN`/`NFR-NN` — `shared/frontmatter-schema.md` § Stable Identifiers) so coverage is greppable
   - **Use Mermaid diagrams** for architecture, data flow, and component relationships — prefer `graph TD`, `flowchart LR`, or `sequenceDiagram` over ASCII art or prose-only descriptions
   - **Testing strategy must include structural verification:** Read `shared/language-verification.md` and include the language-appropriate structural checks (sanitizers, static analysis, type checking) in the Testing Strategy section. These define what "structurally correct" means for this component beyond passing tests.
   - Set status to `draft`

3. **Review**
   - Set `status: review` when dispatching the reviewer
   - Render `shared/agent-prompts/plan-reviewer.md` (substitute the design path and resolved paths) and dispatch it as a collaboration subagent in a fresh context that does not inherit the primary conversation; if collaboration is unavailable, perform the review yourself following that prompt and label it **self-review**
   - Address critical and major issues

4. **Present for Approval**
   - Show the user the review results and final design
   - **Open questions gate approval.** Before setting `status: approved`, every remaining open question must be either resolved or explicitly marked **non-blocking** with a one-line rationale for why the design holds regardless of its answer. A question whose answer could change the architecture blocks approval — leave the design at `review` and name the question to the user. A "⚠️ pending confirmation" annotation is not a gate.
   - After findings are addressed and the user explicitly approves, set `status: approved`. If the user declines or defers, leave it at `review`.
   - Then re-read the frontmatter and confirm it parses as YAML and includes `title`, `type`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `tags`, `related`.

5. **Record Decisions**
   - After approval, record in the decision ledger per `shared/decision-log.md`: each Design Decision the user weighed in on (its rejected options go in the entry's `rejected[]`) and each user-resolved open question. Run the collision check before each append — a collision stops for the user. Scope entries to `Designs/<ComponentName>`, and **cite each new entry's id inline** in the governed Design Decision section (e.g., "(D-0012)"). Design Decisions the user never engaged with are the design's own content — don't promote them as `accepted`.

## Output
```
Designs/<ComponentName>/README.md
```
Plus decision-ledger entries in `Decisions/decisions.md` for user-made design choices and resolved questions.

## Document Structure
See `shared/templates/design.md`:
- **Overview**: Component role in the system
- **Architecture**: Components, data flow, interfaces
- **Design Decisions**: Each with context, options, decision, rationale
- **Error Handling**: Detection, reporting, recovery
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate
- **Migration / Rollout**: Transition plan

## Context
- Orchestration: `shared/orchestration.md`
- Template: `shared/templates/design.md`
- Schema: `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`
- Agent prompts: `shared/agent-prompts/researcher.md`, `shared/agent-prompts/plan-reviewer.md`
