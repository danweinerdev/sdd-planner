# Execute a Plan Phase

## Resources

Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/vcs-detection.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/autonomy.md`, `<plugin-root>/shared/completion-evidence.md`, and `<plugin-root>/shared/language-verification.md` with the matching `<plugin-root>/shared/language-specs/` reference file.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## Preconditions

Read the active plan and phase frontmatter. Read the decision ledger's frontmatter, if one exists (resolve per `shared/decision-log.md` § Ledger location), and note `accepted` entries scoped to this plan or its related specs/designs — pass the relevant statements to implementation dispatches as constraints, but never to intent-isolated review lanes. Confirm the target repository, task dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification commands. If the plan contradicts the codebase, has an unresolved external dependency, or lacks required clarification, stop and surface the mismatch rather than silently changing scope.

## Process

1. Select unfinished tasks whose dependencies are complete. Group independent tasks only when their expected file ownership does not overlap.
2. For each task, confirm it defines one clean, complete, independently
   bisectable feature or internal-capability slice and an explicit native SCM
   revision/checkpoint boundary (D-0014, D-0015). Split or reorder it when a
   smaller complete dependency-ordered unit is available. If it is a horizontal
   half-feature, combines independently complete slices, or cannot leave the
   repository buildable and passing at its boundary, stop and revise the plan
   rather than improvising revision grouping. Then inspect the relevant
   specification/design, code conventions, and test infrastructure and
   implement the task and its tests as that one focused change.
3. Run the required verification and relevant project checks. Fix failures caused by the change. Report pre-existing failures distinctly, with actual output.
4. Optionally dispatch each independent implementation task through collaboration when available. When the runtime provides a task name or description field, set that field to exactly `implement_task` unchanged. Each dispatch supplies exactly one plan task, its target paths, acceptance criteria, `### Trap` content (or that no trap is present), relevant accepted-decision statements as constraints, and verification requirements. Do not request an agent, worker type, provider, or model. Do not depend on any delegation API; when collaboration is unavailable, the primary agent implements the same task transparently. (D-0009)
5. Before finalizing a task's native SCM revision/checkpoint, perform a focused
   code review of its complete diff for correctness, scope, tests,
   maintainability, and whether it is a complete bisectable feature slice.
   Inspect the SCM status and relevant diff views; exclude unrelated work. The
   focused review is required for every completed task. Use `sdd-code-review`
   for phase-level review or material risk; its four-lane phase gate is not a
   substitute for this task review (D-0014).
6. Record the reviewed, verified task as the detected SCM's focused native
   revision/checkpoint. It contains the complete task implementation and tests,
   not another task and not SDD lifecycle/evidence bookkeeping. Confirm the
   recorded revision/checkpoint contains the exact verified bytes and the
   repository remains buildable and testable at that identity. Do not defer the
   native revision/checkpoint merely to collect evidence.

   **Git adapter:** in a commit-capable Git workflow where commits are
   authorized, this native revision is one scoped implementation commit
    (D-0016, D-0017, D-0018). A dirty worktree cannot complete; commit the
    complete slice before recording completion evidence.
7. While the task remains `in-progress`, create `### Completion Evidence` if a
   legacy task lacks it, then replace its pending content using
   `shared/completion-evidence.md`:
   record the verification date, the native SCM revision/checkpoint as canonical
   tested source identity, its immediate identity recheck, every exact
   command with working directory and exit status, every non-command inspection,
   and the observable results satisfying the task's prospective `verification`.
    Also record `Focused review` in strict syntax: for Git, exactly `git show
    <full40>` for final-commit review or `git diff <full40>..<full40>` for range
    review in backticks before `; complete task diff reviewed for correctness,
    scope, tests, maintainability, and task boundary`; then record `Reviewed candidate
    / final` as the exact native SCM identity. **Git review-identity adapter:**
     it is the task full commit or `diff: <full40>..<full40>` with distinct commits,
     a base that is the task revision's direct first parent, and an endpoint at that
     revision, with both commits present in the target repository; the command
     uses that identity with no extra operands. Record `Review
    result: PASS/Aligned`. Other SCMs use their native exact identity; do not
    claim unsupported alternate-diff validation.
    Do not invent a fallback source identity. Dirty Git, no-SCM, and unsupported
    SCM adapters remain non-complete until a durable native revision/checkpoint
    exists. Do not paste a claim unsupported by output read in this session or a
    linked contemporaneous durable record.
8. Re-read the task section. Confirm the evidence is present, no pending marker
   remains, at least one command or tool/inspection row exists, every required
   verification behavior is covered, the source-identity recheck still matches
   the tested content, and every final required check passed.
   Only then set the task status to `complete`, check completed subtasks, and
   update frontmatter. A task with absent, pending, vague, or failing evidence
   stays non-complete.
9. Record the task status, checkboxes, and completion evidence in the planning
   lifecycle artifact through the planning root's approved durable SCM
   revision/checkpoint. This lifecycle record must preserve the task's complete
   state and must not mix source or another feature slice. Re-read the recorded
   artifact and run required SDD validation; completion is not finalized while
   either the implementation or lifecycle record lacks its durable native SCM
   identity. A planning root without approved durable lifecycle transport may
   preserve handoff state but remains non-complete.

   **Git adapter:** make a separate scoped lifecycle commit containing only
   plan/evidence bookkeeping. Evidence continues to name the tested
   implementation commit, avoiding a self-referential lifecycle SHA.
   **Unsupported transport:** no validated durable lifecycle adapter currently
   exists for Perforce or no-SCM planning roots, so leave the task non-complete
   and report that limitation rather than claiming lifecycle completion.

## Escalate

Ask the user before destructive or production-impacting operations, when requirements are ambiguous, when implementation reveals unplanned scope, or after two failed attempts to resolve a blocking verification failure.

**Record escalation resolutions.** When the user answers an escalation with a choice that constrains future work — an ambiguity resolved, scope accepted or cut, an approach picked for a blocked task — record it in the decision ledger per `shared/decision-log.md` (collision check before appending; a collision is itself a stop). If the fresh answer collides with an accepted entry, use the ledger's **one-step supersession**: "this supersedes D-NNNN — confirm?" — don't make the user relitigate what they just decided. Scope the entry to the plan. Pure one-off dispositions ("retry it", "skip for now") are events, not decisions — don't log them.

## Output

For each completed task report files changed, verification commands with actual results, the populated completion-evidence section, status updates, and any deferred findings. Deferred review findings are tracked per `shared/review-artifacts.md` (plan tasks or `FU-NN` follow-ups) — never left only in conversation. Keep the plan artifact as the source of truth.
