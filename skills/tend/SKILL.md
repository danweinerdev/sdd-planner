# Artifact Hygiene

## Path Resolution
Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md` and `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## When to Use
- Artifacts have accumulated and status is unclear
- Before starting new work, to understand what's active
- Periodically, to keep planning artifacts healthy
- After completing a feature cycle (good time to archive)
- When the plan artifacts feel out of sync with reality

## Pre-flight: Legacy Layout Detection

Before running any mode, check whether `Plans/` uses the **legacy status-subfolder layout** (`Plans/New/`, `Plans/Ready/`, `Plans/Active/`, `Plans/Complete/`) instead of the current **flat layout** (plan directories directly under `Plans/`, with lifecycle tracked in each plan README's frontmatter `status` field).

**Detection**: List the contents of `Plans/`. If any of `New/`, `Ready/`, `Active/`, or `Complete/` exist as subdirectories, the layout is legacy.

If legacy layout is detected:

1. **Report** the finding and show which plans were detected:
   ```
   Legacy Plans/ layout detected — plans are stored in status subfolders.

   Found N plans to migrate:
     - Plans/Active/PlanName/ → Plans/PlanName/ (frontmatter status: active)
     - Plans/Complete/OtherPlan/ → Plans/OtherPlan/ (frontmatter status: complete)
     - Plans/New/NewPlan/ → Plans/NewPlan/ (frontmatter status: draft)
   ```

2. **Warn** the user:
   ```
   This migration will move plan directories up to a flat layout under Plans/
   and ensure each plan's README frontmatter `status` reflects its old folder.
   It will cause a significant number of file moves in version control.
   ```

3. **Wait for confirmation**. If the user declines, skip the migration and continue to the requested mode(s) normally — but flag that subsequent commands assume the flat layout.

4. **If confirmed**, perform the migration:
   - For each plan directory inside a status subfolder:
     - Map subfolder back to a status value: `New/` → `draft`, `Ready/` → `approved`, `Active/` → `active`, `Complete/` → `complete`
     - Read the plan's `README.md` frontmatter `status` field. If absent or inconsistent with the subfolder, set it to the subfolder-derived value (subfolder is the source of truth, since that's how the old workflow tracked it).
     - Use the VCS-appropriate move command from `shared/vcs-detection.md` to move the plan directory from `Plans/<Subfolder>/<PlanName>/` to `Plans/<PlanName>/`
   - Remove the now-empty `New/`, `Ready/`, `Active/`, and `Complete/` subdirectories
   - After all moves, report the results

If `Plans/` already has plan directories directly under it and no status subfolders exist, skip this check entirely — the layout is already flat.

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Produces |
|------|---------|----------|
| `migrate` | Pre-flight legacy-layout migration (see above); also runs automatically before other modes when a legacy layout is detected | Layout: plans flat under `Plans/`, status in frontmatter |
| `status` | Verify and update document status fields | Accuracy: documents reflect reality |
| `decisions` | Audit the decision ledger — collisions, stale supersessions, unrecorded decisions | Truth: the ledger is consistent and complete |
| `tags` | Unify tag variants, find connections, identify clusters | Semantics: tags are consistent and meaningful |
| `filenames` | Check naming conventions, suggest renames | Findability: names match content |
| `completeness` | Check for missing frontmatter fields, empty sections | Quality: artifacts are well-formed |

**Dependency chain**: status → decisions → tags → filenames → completeness

Each mode builds on prior work. Status must be accurate before tag analysis is meaningful.

## Invocation

Ask for artifact hygiene across all modes, or name one mode: legacy layout migration, status, decisions, tags, filenames, or completeness.

## Common Pattern

All modes follow delegate-scan → review-findings → confirm → apply:

1. **Scan**: Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to scan artifacts and gather findings (no changes made)
2. **Report**: Primary context presents the agent's findings in categorized format
3. **Confirm**: Wait for user decisions on proposed changes
4. **Apply**: Make confirmed changes and report final state

Never skip confirmation for changes to existing content.

## Mode Details

### Status Mode
Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to scan all plans under `Plans/` and compare status fields against reality. The agent returns a list of findings — what is stale, what is inconsistent, and what should be updated. Checks to perform:
- Plans with all phases complete but plan status is still `active` → suggest `complete`
- Plans with status `active` but no phase has started → suggest reverting to `approved`
- Phases where all tasks are complete but phase status is `in-progress` → suggest `complete`
- Specs/designs marked `approved` but their plan is `complete` → suggest `implemented`
- Research/brainstorm still `active` but frontmatter `updated` more than 30 days before today → flag as potentially stale
- Phase status `in-progress` but no task has started → flag inconsistency
- Review artifacts (`reviews/` dirs, type `review`) still `open` whose target has since moved forward (spec/design approved, plan phase complete) → the findings were either addressed without Resolution Log entries or silently dropped; flag for resolution or explicit supersession
- Review `followups[]` entries with an empty `tracked_in` → floating follow-up work; flag until it lands as a plan task

**Refresh triggers**: Artifacts may declare an optional `refresh_when` frontmatter field — a list of event-shaped trigger descriptions (e.g., "dependency X ships v3", "Specs/Payments changes", "the vendor answers the webhooks question"). For artifacts that declare it: report each artifact with its triggers and ask the user which (if any) have fired — fired triggers make the artifact stale regardless of its `updated` date, and an artifact whose triggers have all demonstrably not fired is NOT stale even past 30 days. Artifacts without `refresh_when` keep the 30-day rule above. Where a trigger names another artifact (e.g., "Specs/Payments changes"), check that artifact's `updated` date yourself instead of asking.

### Decisions Mode
Resolve the ledger per `shared/decision-log.md` § Ledger location (`Decisions/decisions.md` under the planning root, or each mapped repo's `DECISIONS.md` for external planning roots — audit every resolvable ledger). Skip silently if none exists. Otherwise use a collaboration subagent (if available), rendering `shared/agent-prompts/researcher.md`, to audit the decision ledger against `shared/decision-log.md` and the other artifacts. Checks to perform:
- **Collisions among `accepted` entries** — run the structural checks from `shared/decision-log.md` across all accepted pairs, using its scope-overlap definition (shared/nested paths, or artifacts connected via `related` frontmatter; empty scope is global and overlaps everything); the append-time check can miss pairs that predate it. Each collision goes to the user to reconcile — never auto-resolve.
- **Superseded-but-still-cited** — grep `Specs/`, `Designs/`, `Plans/` for `D-NNNN` id citations of entries whose status is `superseded` or `rejected`; flag the citing artifacts as possibly stale. Also flag governed sections that cite no id at all where a scoped accepted entry exists (missing bidirectional link).
- **Dangling scope** — `scope` references to artifacts that no longer exist.
- **Unrecorded decisions** — Key Decisions / Design Decisions / Decisions Made sections in approved-or-later artifacts with no corresponding ledger entry; offer backfill (as `proposed` unless the user confirms each).
- **Stale proposals** — `proposed` entries older than 30 days; ask the user to accept, reject, or keep waiting.
- **Fired assumptions** — `assumption` entries whose `refresh_when` triggers have fired; reconcile like a collision.
- **Duplicate-id repair and malformed entries** — per `shared/decision-log.md` § Concurrency and § Hygiene.
- **Rotation** — past ~100 entries, offer to move `superseded` and `rejected` entries to `Decisions/archive-<YYYY>.md` (type `decision-log`, status `archived`); ids stay unique across live ledger and archives, and `accepted`/`proposed` entries never rotate.

### Tags Mode
Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to scan all artifact frontmatter for tags and analyze for variants, orphans, missing tags, and clusters. The agent returns the analysis. Checks to perform:
- **Variants**: Find tags that are likely the same thing (`api`/`APIs`/`rest-api`)
- **Orphans**: Tags used in only one document (might be too specific)
- **Missing**: Artifacts with empty tags that could be inferred from content
- **Clusters**: Groups of artifacts that share tag patterns (reveals implicit categories)

### Filenames Mode
Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to check naming conventions across all artifacts. The agent returns any violations found. Conventions to check (defined in AGENTS.md):
- Plans: `Plans/<PlanName>/README.md`, phases `01-Phase-Name.md`
- Specs: `Specs/<FeatureName>/README.md`
- Designs: `Designs/<ComponentName>/README.md`
- Research: `Research/<topic-slug>.md` (kebab-case)
- Brainstorm: `Brainstorm/<topic-slug>.md` (kebab-case)
- Retro: `Retro/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Diagrams: `Diagrams/<slug>.md` (kebab-case, type `diagram`; statuses `draft`/`active`/`archived`)
- Phase numbering: zero-padded, sequential, no gaps

### Completeness Mode
Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to check each artifact against `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`. The agent returns missing fields and empty sections. Checks to perform:
- Required frontmatter fields present (title, type, status, created, updated)
- Body has expected sections per template
- Plans have at least one phase defined
- Phases have at least one task defined
- Related links point to artifacts that exist
- Requirements and acceptance criteria in approved-or-later specs carry stable ids (`FR-NN`/`NFR-NN`/`AC-NN`), and plan tasks cite the ids they satisfy (`shared/frontmatter-schema.md` § Stable Identifiers)
- Id citations resolve: every cited `FR-NN`/`AC-NN`/task id exists in the artifact that owns it (a dangling citation means something was renumbered or removed without reconciliation)

## Sequential Execution

When running all modes:

1. Run legacy layout detection pre-flight (if applicable)
2. Run status mode to completion
3. Ask: "Status complete. Continue to decisions?"
4. On confirmation, run decisions mode (skipped silently when no ledger exists), then ask: "Decisions complete. Continue to tags?"
5. On confirmation, run tags mode
6. Ask: "Tags complete. Continue to filenames?"
7. On confirmation, run filenames mode
8. Ask: "Filenames complete. Continue to completeness?"
9. On confirmation, run completeness mode
10. Present final summary

User can stop after any mode.

## Output
Modifies artifacts in place based on user-confirmed changes. No new artifacts created.

## Context
- Orchestration: `shared/orchestration.md`
- Schema: `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`
- Conventions: `AGENTS.md`
