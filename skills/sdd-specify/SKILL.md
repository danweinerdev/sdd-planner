# Write Requirements Specification

## Path Resolution
Before opening `shared/...`, follow symlinks in this loaded file's path, then derive `<plugin-root>` from `<plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; fallback search roots are repository/user `.agents/` (including `$HOME/.agents/plugins/*/`), Codex `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/*/*/*/`, and runtime-configured skill roots. Accept only a root containing this skill, `shared/agent-runtime.md`, and the matching plugin manifest; never use the working directory. Then read `<plugin-root>/shared/agent-runtime.md` and `<plugin-root>/shared/path-resolution.md`.

**Resource boundary:** Read the plugin, all `SKILL.md` files, and `shared/` resources in place. Never copy or symlink them into the working directory, target repository, or planning root. Only generated SDD outputs may be materialized from bundled resources.

## When to Use
When you need to define the requirements for a feature before designing or implementing it. Produces a testable, reviewable specification.

## Process

1. **Gather Context**
   - If the user hasn't already specified it, ask what feature to specify
   - Render `shared/agent-prompts/researcher.md` (substitute the topic, resolved paths, and your questions) and dispatch it as a collaboration subagent (if available); otherwise perform the research pass yourself following that prompt
   - Review any related research or brainstorm documents

2. **Draft Specification**
   - Create `Specs/<FeatureName>/README.md` using `shared/templates/spec.md`
   - Write: overview, goals, non-goals, requirements (functional + non-functional), user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, dependencies
   - **Number requirements and acceptance criteria with stable ids** (`FR-NN`/`NFR-NN`/`AC-NN` per `shared/frontmatter-schema.md` § Stable Identifiers) — downstream designs and plan tasks cite these ids, so they are append-only and never renumbered
   - When the spec captures an **external contract** (a third-party API, protocol, wire format, or another team's interface), pin the source: link the authoritative doc and record its version and as-of date in the spec. Downstream implementation is only allowed to derive external-contract behavior from this captured source — never from model memory — so the pin is load-bearing.
   - Set status to `draft`

3. **Review**
   - Set `status: review` when dispatching the reviewer
   - Render `shared/agent-prompts/spec-reviewer.md` (substitute the spec path and resolved paths) and dispatch it as a collaboration subagent in a fresh context that does not inherit the primary conversation — the reviewer must judge the spec as written, not your intent
   - If collaboration is unavailable, perform the review pass yourself following that prompt and label the result **self-review** — do not claim independent corroboration
   - Address critical and major issues; re-dispatch the reviewer after material revisions

4. **Present for Approval**
   - Show the user the review results and final spec
   - **Open questions gate approval.** Before setting `status: approved`, every remaining open question must be either resolved or explicitly marked **non-blocking** with a one-line rationale for why the requirements hold regardless of its answer. A question whose answer could change in-scope requirements blocks approval — leave the spec at `review` and name the question to the user. A "⚠️ pending confirmation" annotation is not a gate.
   - After findings are addressed and the user explicitly approves, set `status: approved`. If the user declines or defers, leave it at `review`.
   - Then re-read the frontmatter and confirm it parses as YAML and includes `title`, `type`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `tags`, `related`.

5. **Record Decisions**
   - After approval, record each user-resolved open question and each user-made scoping/requirements choice in the decision ledger per `shared/decision-log.md` (run its collision check before each append — a collision stops for the user). Scope entries to `Specs/<FeatureName>`, and **cite each new entry's id inline** in the governed spec section (e.g., "(D-0017)") — the bidirectional link is what makes supersession detection work. Skip questions marked non-blocking without a user answer — nothing was decided.

## Output
```
Specs/<FeatureName>/README.md
```
Plus decision-ledger entries in `Decisions/decisions.md` for user-resolved questions.

## Document Structure
See `shared/templates/spec.md`:
- **Overview**: Feature purpose
- **Goals / Non-Goals**: Scope boundaries
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional
- **User Stories**: As a [user], I want to...
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable pass/fail criteria
- **Constraints / Dependencies / Open Questions**

## Context

- Schema: `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`
