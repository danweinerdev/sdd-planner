# Progressive Codebase Discovery

## Path Resolution
Read `shared/agent-runtime.md` to locate bundled resources, then read `shared/path-resolution.md` to resolve artifact and target-repository paths.

## When to Use
When you need to understand an unfamiliar codebase or subsystem before planning work against it. Produces research artifacts from systematic code exploration — not a quick scan, but a deep dive that builds on itself.

## Process

1. **Choose Entry Point**
   - Ask what area of the codebase to explore (or the whole thing)
   - If a `planning-config.local.json` exists, read it to find local repo paths
   - Identify starting points:
     - Entry files (`main.py`, `index.ts`, `cmd/`, `src/main/`)
     - Configuration files (understand what's configurable)
     - Package manifests (understand dependencies)
     - README/docs (understand intent)

2. **Surface Survey**
   - Use a collaboration subagent (if available) to scan the target codebase:
     - Directory structure and file organization
     - Key modules/packages and their responsibilities
     - Entry points and public APIs
     - Configuration and environment setup
   - Map the high-level architecture: what talks to what

3. **Depth Passes**
   Work through the codebase layer by layer. For each pass, use a collaboration subagent when available, passing the prior pass's findings as context. Otherwise perform the pass directly. Review each pass's summary before steering the next one.

   **Pass 1: Structure**
   - Module boundaries and dependency graph
   - Shared types / data models
   - Configuration flow

   **Pass 2: Behavior**
   - Request/data flow through the system
   - State management patterns
   - Error handling patterns
   - Key algorithms or business logic

   **Pass 3: Patterns**
   - Recurring patterns and conventions
   - Testing approach and coverage
   - Build/deploy pipeline
   - Known technical debt (TODOs, FIXMEs, deprecated code)

   Each pass produces findings that inform the next. Don't try to understand everything at once.

4. **Synthesize**
   - Create `Research/<codebase-or-subsystem-slug>.md` using `shared/templates/research.md`
   - Organize findings into:
     - **Architecture**: How the system is structured (use Mermaid `graph TD` or `flowchart` diagrams)
     - **Key Patterns**: Conventions the codebase follows
     - **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system (use Mermaid `flowchart LR` or `sequenceDiagram`)
     - **Dependencies**: External and internal dependencies
     - **Findings**: Insights, risks, technical debt
     - **Open Questions**: What remains unclear after exploration

5. **Link**
   - Add cross-references to any related artifacts in `related` frontmatter
   - If the excavation reveals spec-worthy features, note them as recommendations

## Output
```
Research/<codebase-or-subsystem-slug>.md
```

## Depth Guidance

- **Breadth first, depth second**: Map the whole system before diving into any one part
- **Follow the data**: Understanding data flow reveals architecture faster than reading code top-down
- **Name the patterns**: If the codebase uses MVC, hexagonal, event-driven, etc., name it — this anchors future discussions
- **Note surprises**: Anything that doesn't match expectations is worth documenting — it's either a bug, a design decision, or tribal knowledge
- **Stop when diminishing returns**: You don't need to understand every line. Stop when you can confidently describe what each major component does and how they interact

## Context
- Orchestration: `shared/orchestration.md`
- Template: `shared/templates/research.md`
- Schema: `shared/frontmatter-schema.md`
- Agent: a collaboration subagent (if available)
- Local repo paths: `planning-config.local.json`
